# KnnProjectFinal
Project 1 for the Malis course at EURECOM

Notes to self: I have modified the class knn to suit my needs:
- Renamed train to fit because Sklearn cross validation requires this convention
- Added a function get_params for the same reason
- I dont use the minkowski distance but implemented it nontheless, it seems it is a requirement in the project description
- I don't use cross validation in the second dataset, the sake of the second demonstration was not rigor but rather making sure that we obtain similar results to the official implementation of sklearn

Project finished.
